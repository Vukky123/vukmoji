The Vukmoji License

I don't really care where you use these. Just provide a visible link back to the vukmoji github repository.
This should be somewhere actually visible!

Say, for Discord, in a rules channel or some other read-only channel.
Sending a link to it in your chat channel which can be flooded away easily is not permitted.
